**Real-Time Speech-to-Braille Translation for the Deaf-Blind**

Abstract:
<p align="justify">The project aims to develop a system that empowers deaf-blind individuals by facilitating real-time communication using Speech-to-Braille translation technology. Deaf-blind people face unique challenges in conversing and accessing information, often relying on tactile methods such as Braille. However, not all people know the tactile language, and therefore deaf-blind people find it difficult to interact with them. Here comes the relevance of our project. It helps them understand real-time conversations. The methodologies we are going to use to develop this system are speech recognition techniques and ASCII-to-braille conversion algorithms. Upon research, we found that there is currently a technology gap when it comes to giving the deaf-blind community real-time speech comprehension tools. Most of the systems currently in use are text-to-Braille converters that are primarily targeted at blind people but also accessible to the deaf-blind community. The project's real-time speech-to-Braille translation system, which was developed with the deaf-blind community in mind, is what makes it innovative. By enabling deaf-blind people to participate more fully in social, educational, and professional settings in ways that were previously unattainable to them, this innovation has the potential to significantly improve communication and accessibility for deaf-blind people. The system's limitations arise from the fact that many deaf-blind individuals may not be able to initiate conversations as they do not own smartphones. Braille Displays are also very expensive and difficult to obtain, which could potentially exclude some members of the deaf-blind community from its use. In conclusion, with a focus on addressing device accessibility and affordability, 'EchoFeel' offers hope for empowering the deaf-blind community in communication.</p>
